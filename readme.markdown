Adaptive-Images for WordPress
=============================
This is not just the WordPress version of the original Adaptive-Images by Matt Wilcox. This is an extended version with which you can configure individually the responsive behavior of each image in the layout.

theme/config/adaptive-images-config.php
```php
$setup = array(
  'banner' => array(
    'resolutions' => array(
      '0' => array(
        'w' => 480 // the image will have a physical width of 480px on screens with less then 480px width
      ),
      '480' => array(
        'w' => 768 // the image will have a physical width of 768px on screens with minimum 480px and less then 768p width
      ),
      '768' => array(
        'w' => 1024
      ),
      '1024' => array(
        'w' => 1200
       )
    )
   )
);
```
theme/page.php â€“ or any other presentation file
```php
// you simply can attach the behavior 'banner' to an image
<img src="image.jpg?size=banner">

// but using the get_adaptive_image() function is a much future proof solution
echo get_adaptive_image( array(
  'name' => 'banner', 
  'id' => {image-ID}, 
) );
```
Explanation: The key ```'banner'``` in the array ```$setup``` is the name of an imageset, that holds all the configuration for the responsive behavior of an image, that is called with the name parameter ```'banner'``` via the function get_adaptive_image().

Dependencies
------------
* Browser with Javascript enabled and exepting Cookies
  JavaScript is needed for detecting the screens height and width. A Cookie is needed for temporarily storing the screens height and width and making this data aviable in the adaptive-images script.
